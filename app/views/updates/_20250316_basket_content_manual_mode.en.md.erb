# Improvements to manual distribution mode in basket contents

In the "basket content" feature, the manual distribution mode has been optimized for more intuitive and efficient use.

### Automatic calculation of total quantity

In manual distribution mode, the total quantity is now automatically calculated based on the quantities entered for each basket size and the number of associated baskets. This eliminates the need for manual calculations or rough estimates.

### Better transition between modes

In manual distribution mode, percentages are now also automatically calculated from the quantities entered. Switching from one distribution mode to another becomes simpler, while preserving the entered values.
