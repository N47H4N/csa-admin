# Newsletters, Improvements and Scheduling

Following our discussions at the beginning of the year, the following features have been added to newsletters:

- Display of the list of recipient emails/members in draft mode, with preview for each delivery.
- Ability to send an already sent newsletter to new emails/members (only possible within the week following the initial send).
- Automatic scheduling of newsletters. The sending will be performed during the night of the chosen date.

Find more information about newsletters in [the handbook](/handbook/newsletters).
