# New email templates for memberships

Four new email templates have been added for [memberships](/mail_templates?scope=membership) to facilitate communication with your members:

- [Initial Basket](/mail_templates/membership_initial_basket)
- [Final Basket](/mail_templates/membership_final_basket)
- [First Basket](/mail_templates/membership_first_basket) (of the year)
- [Last Basket](/mail_templates/membership_last_basket) (of the year)

These templates are disabled by default. Once their content is customized, you can enable them at your convenience from the [email templates management page](/mail_templates).
