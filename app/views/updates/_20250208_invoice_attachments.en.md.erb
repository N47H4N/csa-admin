# Invoices: Adding Attachments

It is now possible to attach files to [manually created invoices](/invoices/new).

These files will be sent as attachments in [the "New Invoice" email](/mail_templates/invoice_created) addressed to the member, in addition to the invoice PDF.

Attachments can also be added [to shop orders](/shop_orders/new) and will be automatically included during billing.
