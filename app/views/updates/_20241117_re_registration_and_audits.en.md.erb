# Re-registration and member audits

Former inactive members who re-register via the online form are now automatically placed on the waiting list with their new information, instead of receiving an error message indicating that their email is not available. Admins still receive a "New registration" notification, specifying that it is a re-registration.

Additionally, you can now view the full history of a member's changes using the new "Audits" button located at the top right of each profile. This tool makes it easy to trace which information has been modified, when, and by which user, which is particularly useful in the context of re-registrations.

I hope these improvements will be useful to you! I remain at your disposal for any questions or suggestions.
