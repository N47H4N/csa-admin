# <%= activities_human_name %>, invoicing by fiscal year

The [invoicing of uncompleted activity participations](/invoices/new) can now specify the relevant fiscal year. This allows for invoicing activities from the previous year without having to backdate the invoice.

It is also possible to cancel the missing activities from the previous year, either from [the participation page](/activity_participations) (see image below) or from the page of an old subscription. This resets the number of required activities for the affected subscriptions to zero.
