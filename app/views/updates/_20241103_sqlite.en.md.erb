# Database Change (SQLite)

This weekend, I performed an open-heart operation on the platform and migrated the database from PostgreSQL to SQLite.

In practice, this shouldn't change anything for you, except for a slight improvement in the application's performance. However, some differences, such as a different sorting order on certain lists, may have escaped my notice. If you notice anything unusual, please feel free to let me know. Thank you!

Technically, this means that each organization now has its own SQLite database, rather than sharing a common PostgreSQL database (with separate schemas). This simplifies data management and ensures better data isolation between organizations. Each SQLite database is also continuously backed up via [Litestream](https://litestream.io). Your data and their backups are still hosted at Infomaniak, in Switzerland.

SQLite is the most widely used database system in the world, recognized for its great reliability, longevity, and being open-source. More information about SQLite is available on [the official website](https://www.sqlite.org/about.html).
