# CSA Admin 🌐

As announced some time ago, ACP Admin has recently changed its name to CSA Admin ([Community Supported Agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture)). This name change marks a new chapter in the application's history and aims to make it more accessible outside of French-speaking Switzerland, where the term ACP is not well known.

A new website, [csa-admin.org](https://csa-admin.org), is now available and translated into three languages:

- CSA / English: [csa-admin.org](https://csa-admin.org)
- ACP / French: [csa-admin.org/acp](https://csa-admin.org/acp)
- Solawi / German: [csa-admin.org/solawi](https://csa-admin.org/solawi)

To enhance the international aspect of the application, the manual and the entire application have also been translated into English, German, and Italian. Please let me know of any translation errors or suggestions to improve the quality of the translation.

The contact/support email has also changed to [info@csa-admin.org](mailto:info@csa-admin.org). Please update your contacts. The old site and email will remain active during a transition period.

Thank you for your support and trust. 🫶🏻<br/>Thibaud
