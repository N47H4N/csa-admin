# Billing Name and Address

Members can now specify a separate billing name and address when signing up or modifying their account. An administrator can also modify this address by checking the option "Use another name and address for billing" in the member's profile.

This feature replaces the "delivery address" option, which is now fixed to the member's main address.

The billing address, which is optional, is used exclusively for generating new invoices.
