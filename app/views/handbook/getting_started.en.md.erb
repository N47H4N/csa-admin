# Getting Started

Welcome! This guide presents the first steps to set up CSA Admin and prepare [your registration form](<%= new_members_member_url(subdomain: Current.org.members_subdomain) %>). Let's get started!

## 1. Settings

Taking a tour through [the settings](/settings) is a good way to discover the various available configurations. You can start by filling out [the general settings](/settings), those concerning [emails](/settings#mail), as well as certain aspects of [billing](/settings#billing), for example, the first month of your fiscal year, payment intervals offered to your members, or the number of trial baskets... If some points haven't been decided yet, no problem, you can define them later.

Some [settings specific to the registration form](/settings#registration) are also available, but they are all optional.

## 2. Deliveries

[Delivery dates](/deliveries) are an essential element, as their number determines the price of your annual memberships (deliveries * price of basket size). Deliveries are therefore required to be able to [create memberships](/memberships/new).

[A manual page](/handbook/deliveries) concerning them is available, with a section on [delivery cycles](/handbook/deliveries#delivery-cycles).

> Even if you're not certain about the dates, make sure to have the correct number of deliveries for the upcoming fiscal year so that the prices displayed in the registration form are correct. You can always modify these dates later.

## 3. Basket Sizes

Basket sizes determine the type of membership (small, large, ...) offered to your members. It's also possible to have certain sizes not visible in the form and thus only applicable by an admin.

Depending on [the additional features activated in the settings](/settings#organization_features_input), it's also possible to define a different number of half-day work shifts or share capital for each basket size.

## 4. Basket Complements (optional)

[Basket complements](/basket_complements) are, for example, a bread, cheese, eggs subscription... added to the basic basket membership. These complements are exclusively available for members with a membership.

The price of a complement, like that of the basket size, is set by default based on the number of deliveries in the membership, but it's also possible to define a fixed annual price that won't depend on the number of deliveries.

Each complement can also be delivered on specific deliveries, for example only during the winter period or every other week.

## 5. Depots

[Depots](/depots) represent the locations where members can go to pick up their baskets. You need at least one to be able to create memberships.

A price can also be defined for each depot, for example to represent additional basket preparation or delivery costs. This will then be automatically taken into account when billing memberships.

> In the "contact" section of the depot, you can define a list of emails that will automatically receive, the day before each delivery, the signature sheet (PDF) and the Excel summary concerning them.

## 6. Email Templates

You can take a look at the [email templates section](/mail_templates) and perhaps modify their content. You also have the possibility to modify and activate [a welcome email for newly validated registrations](/mail_templates/member_validated) or another when [the last trial basket of a membership is delivered](/mail_templates/membership_last_trial_basket).

## 7. Inviting Other Admins

Finally, you have the possibility to [invite other admins](/admins/new), an email will then be automatically sent to them so they can connect and join you!

[Specific access permissions](/permissions) can be configured if needed.
