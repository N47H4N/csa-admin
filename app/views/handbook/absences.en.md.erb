# Absences

This feature allows you to manage your members' absences and automatically deduct absent baskets from your deliveries. Your members can announce their absences directly from their member area. You can also add absences for your members as an admin ([Other > Absences](/absences)).

## Configuration

Once this additional feature is activated in [your settings](/settings#organization_features_input), [several settings](/settings#absence) allow you to configure the explanation text as well as the notice period.

## Billing

By default, baskets marked as absent and not delivered are billed, and members are advised to find an acquaintance to collect their basket in their place. In [the settings](/settings#absence), you can also choose not to bill them. The system will then automatically [adjust the billing](/handbook/billing#price-change) of the membership.

## Included Absences

It is also possible to configure a number of absences included in the membership. These absences are then automatically deducted and not billed from the start of the membership. The system will provisionally mark the last deliveries of the membership as absent, until the number of included absences is announced by the member. Additional absences will be billed or not according to [your settings](/settings#absence).

> The number of included absences can also be set at the level of a [delivery cycle](/handbook/deliveries#delivery-cycles), in order to offer memberships with a number of included absences (and therefore deliveries) on [your registration form](<%= new_members_member_url(subdomain: Current.org.members_subdomain) %>).
