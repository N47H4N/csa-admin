# Members

A member represents a person, family, shared accommodation, or company, and allows you to manage their information (address, contact details, etc.). A member’s membership is managed via their subscriptions, with only one subscription per fiscal year.

A member is created through the [registration form](<%= new_members_member_url(subdomain: Current.org.members_subdomain) %>) or by an admin through the [member creation form](/members/new).

## Statuses

### To validate

New members created using the [registration form](<%= new_members_member_url(subdomain: Current.org.members_subdomain) %>) are added to [the list of members to validate](/members?scope=pending). They must be validated by an administrator to ensure that all information is correct.

It is possible to automatically send a welcome email when validating a member by configuring [the "Member validated" email template](/mail_templates/member_validated).

> Administrators can be notified by email when a new registration occurs by managing their [notification preferences](<%= edit_admin_path(current_admin) %>).

### Waiting list

Once validated, or directly created by an admin, a member with a (pending) subscription configuration ends up on the waiting list. The waiting list is useful for organizations that have a capacity limit on active members.

To make a member active, simply create a subscription for them (click "Create a subscription" at the top right of the member’s page). The (pending) subscription configuration is automatically carried into the subscription creation form.

It is possible to automatically send a welcome email when activating a member by configuring [the "Member activated" email template](/mail_templates/member_activated).

### Active

An active member is one who has a subscription for the current or future fiscal year. A member who has a defined depot for grocery orders is also considered active.

As soon as the current subscription is ended or deleted, the member becomes inactive.

### Support

A support member is one without any subscriptions who pays an annual fee (for associations) or who owns share capital (for cooperatives). If a subscription is created for a support member, they become active.

Using the "Make inactive" button at the top right of the member’s page, it is possible to make a support member inactive, which will remove their annual fee or set their required share capital to zero.

Using the "Put on waiting list" button at the top right of the member’s page, you can put a support member back on the waiting list. Their annual fee or number of share capital remains unchanged.

### Inactive

An inactive member is one who does not have a subscription for the current or future fiscal year and does not pay an annual fee or have share capital. An inactive member can be put on the waiting list again.

Using the "Put on waiting list" button at the top right of the member’s page, you can put a support member on the waiting list. Their annual fee will then be reset to the organization’s default value.
